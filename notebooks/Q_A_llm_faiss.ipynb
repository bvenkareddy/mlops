KEYWORDS CI/CD, DevOps, Machine Learning, MLOps, Operations, Workflow Orchestration 1 Introduction  Machine Learning (ML) has become an important technique to leverage the potential of data and allows businesses to be more innovative [1], efficient [13], and sustainable [22]. However, the success of many productive ML applications in real-world settings falls short of expectations [21]. A large number of ML projects fail—with many ML proofs of concept never progressing as far as production [30]. From a research perspective, this does not come as a surprise as the ML community has focused extensively on the building of ML models, but not on (a) building production-ready ML products and (b) providing the necessary coordination of the resulting, often complex ML system components and infrastructure, including the roles required to automate and operate an ML system in a real-world setting [35]. For instance, in many industrial applications, data scientists still manage ML workflows manually  † This paper does not represent an official IBM statement to a great extent, resulting in many issues during the operations of the respective ML solution [26].  To address these issues, the goal of this work is to examine how manual ML processes can be automated and operationalized so that more ML proofs of concept can be brought into production. In this work, we explore the emerging ML engineering practice “Machine Learning Operations”—MLOps for short—precisely addressing the issue of designing and maintaining productive ML. We take a holistic perspective to gain a common understanding of the involved components, principles, roles, and architectures. While existing research sheds some light on various specific aspects of MLOps, a holistic conceptualization, generalization, and clarification of ML systems design are still missing. Different perspectives and conceptions of the term “MLOps” might lead to misunderstandings and miscommunication, which, in turn, can lead to errors in the overall setup of the entire ML system. Thus, we ask the research question: RQ: What is MLOps? To answer that question, we conduct a mixed-method research endeavor to (a) identify important principles of MLOps, (b) carve out functional core components, (c) highlight the roles necessary to successfully implement MLOps, and (d) derive a general architecture for ML systems design. In combination, these insights result in a definition of MLOps, which contributes to a common understanding of the term and related concepts.

This stems from potentially voluminous and varying data [10], which makes it difficult to precisely estimate the necessary infrastructure resources (CPU, RAM, and GPU) and requires a high level of flexibility in terms of scalability of the infrastructure [7,26] [δ]. Operational challenges. In productive settings, it is challenging to operate ML manually due to different stacks of software and hardware components and their interplay. Therefore, robust automation is required [7,17]. Also, a constant incoming stream of new data forces retraining capabilities. This is a repetitive task which, again, requires a high level of automation [18] [θ]. These repetitive tasks yield a large number of artifacts that require a strong governance [24,29,40] as well as versioning of data, model, and code to ensure robustness and reproducibility [11,27,29]. Lastly, it is challenging to resolve a potential support request (e.g., by finding the root cause), as many parties and components are involved. Failures can be a combination of ML infrastructure and software [26]. 8 Conclusion With the increase of data availability and analytical capabilities, coupled with the constant pressure to innovate, more machine learning products than ever are being developed. However, only a small number of these proofs of concept progress into deployment and production. Furthermore, the academic space has focused intensively on machine learning model building and benchmarking, but too little on operating complex machine learning systems in real-world scenarios. In the real world, we observe data scientists still managing ML workflows manually to a great extent. The paradigm of Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) addresses these challenges. In this work, we shed more light on MLOps.

The source code repository ensures code storing and versioning. It allows multiple developers to commit and merge their code [17,25,42,44,46] [α, β, γ, ζ, θ]. Examples include Bitbucket [11] [ζ], GitLab [11,17] [ζ], GitHub [25] [ζ ,η], and Gitea [46]. C3 Workflow Orchestration Component (P2, P3, P6). The workflow orchestration component offers task orchestration of an ML workflow via directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). These graphs represent execution order and artifact usage of single steps of the workflow [26,32,35,40,41,46] [α, β, γ, δ, ε, ζ, η]. Examples include Apache Airflow [α, ζ], Kubeflow Pipelines [ζ], Luigi [ζ], AWS SageMaker Pipelines [β], and Azure Pipelines [ε]. C4 Feature Store System (P3, P4). A feature store system ensures central storage of commonly used features. It has two databases configured: One database as an offline feature store to serve features with normal latency for experimentation, and one database as an online store to serve features with low latency for predictions in production [10,14] [α, β, ζ, ε, θ]. Examples include Google Feast [ζ], Amazon AWS Feature Store [β, ζ], Tecton.ai and Hopswork.ai [ζ]. This is where most of the data for training ML models will come from. Moreover, data can also come directly from any kind of data store. C5 Model Training Infrastructure (P6). The model training infrastructure provides the foundational computation resources, e.g., CPUs, RAM, and GPUs. The provided infrastructure can be either distributed or non-distributed. In general, a scalable and distributed infrastructure is recommended [7,10,24–26,29,40,45,46] [δ, ζ, η, θ]. Examples include local machines (not scalable) or cloud computation [7] [η, θ], as well as non-distributed or distributed computation (several worker nodes) [25,27]. Frameworks supporting computation are Kubernetes [η, θ] and Red Hat OpenShift [γ]. C6 Model Registry (P3, P4). The model registry stores centrally the trained ML models together with their metadata. It has two main functionalities: storing the ML artifact and storing the ML metadata (see C7) [4,6,14,17,26,27] [α, β, γ, ε, ζ, η, θ]. Advanced storage examples include MLflow [α, η, ζ], AWS SageMaker Model Registry [ζ], Microsoft Azure ML Model Registry [ζ], and Neptune.ai [α]. Simple storage examples include Microsoft Azure Storage, Google Cloud Storage, and Amazon AWS S3 [17]. C7 ML Metadata Stores (P4, P7). ML metadata stores allow for the tracking of various kinds of metadata, e.g., for each orchestrated ML workflow pipeline task. Another metadata store can be configured within the model registry for tracking and logging the metadata of each training job (e.g., training date and time, duration, etc.), including the model specific metadata—e.g., used parameters and the resulting performance metrics, model lineage: data and code used [14,25–27,32] [α, β, δ, ζ, θ]. Examples include orchestrators with built-in metadata stores tracking each step of experiment pipelines [α] such as Kubeflow Pipelines [α,ζ], AWS SageMaker Pipelines [α,ζ], Azure ML, and IBM Watson Studio [γ]. MLflow provides an advanced metadata store in combination with the model registry [32,35].  C8 Model Serving Component (P1). The model serving component can be configured for different purposes. Examples are online inference for real-time predictions or batch inference for predictions using large volumes of input data. The serving can be provided, e.g., via a REST API. As a foundational infrastructure layer, a scalable and distributed model serving infrastructure is recommended [7,11,25,40,45,46] [α, β, δ, ζ, η, θ]. One example of a model serving component configuration is the use of Kubernetes and Docker technology to containerize the ML model, and leveraging a Python web application framework like Flask [17] with an API for serving [α]. Other Kubernetes supported frameworks are KServing of Kubeflow [α], TensorFlow Serving, and Seldion.io serving [40].
